            <p class="abstract">
              Within OBCR, we have developed a highly selective and efficient
              singlet oxygen mediated crosslink technology which is applicable
              to peptide-protein, peptide-nucleic acid and nucleic acid
              interstrand crosslink scenarios. For this purpose, a furan
              ‘warhead’ is introduced into one of the biomolecular partners and
              subsequently activated by means of an oxidation trigger such as
              singlet oxygen which induces generation of a nucleophile sensitive
              keto-enal moiety. The overall procedure allows for spatiotemporal
              control of the crosslinking event. In the context of peptide
              ligand-receptor interactions, we have described, in live cells
              under normal growth conditions, spontaneous enzymatic activation
              and crosslinking of furan-modified peptide ligands to their
              membrane GPCR with zero toxicity, high efficiency and
              spatio-specificity. Furan introduction into peptide and protein
              ligands and subsequent covalent modification of their natural
              targets was achieved after triggering photocatalytic singlet
              oxygen generation. Furan-modified oligonucleotide probes were
              designed for efficient and selective crosslinking to natural
              nucleic acid targets, including the elusive G-quadruplex and
              I-motif targets. Singlet oxygen mediated furan oxidation was
              further applied to aptamer stapling. Introduction of a slightly
              modified furan moiety into peptides and peptide nucleic acids
              (PNAs) allowed development of a triggerless proximity-induced
              click ligation with applications in nucleic acid biomarker
              detection and protein array design as well as peptide cyclisation.
              Furan moieties were further converted, using singlet oxygen, into
              versatile building blocks for site-selective modification of
              proteins and synthesis of bioconjugates. The talk will highlight
              selected specific examples of these cross-linking and conjugation
              methodologies.

            <p class="abstract">
              The course addresses one of the central technological challenges
              in renewable energy conversion: the development of efficient,
              durable, and scalable components for alkaline water electrolysis.
              With growing global demand for green hydrogen, advances in
              membrane and electrode materials are essential to improve both
              performance and cost-effectiveness, enabling large-scale
              deployment of electrolysis technologies. The program introduces
              participants to state-of-the-art testing and diagnostic protocols
              (polarization curves, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,
              durability assessments, and degradation mechanism analysis),
              providing a rigorous framework to evaluate and compare
              electrolysis components. Drawing from DTU Energy case studies, the
              course bridges fundamental materials research with practical
              implementation, covering systems from bench scale to prototype
              development.

            <p class="abstract">
              High-throughput experimentation (HTE) is increasingly recognized
              as a key methodology in contemporary organic synthesis. By
              allowing the systematic evaluation of hundreds of reactions in
              parallel, HTE moves beyond traditional trial-and-error approaches
              and provides a comprehensive and unbiased view of reactivity. This
              capability not only accelerates the discovery of new
              transformations but also enables a deeper understanding of
              catalytic mechanisms and the factors that govern selectivity. The
              impact of HTE extends across a wide range of applications: from
              the rapid screening of catalysts, ligands, and reaction
              conditions, to the exploration of large and diverse chemical
              spaces that would be impractical using conventional methods. Its
              integration into both academic and industrial research programs
              has proven essential for advancing sustainable synthesis, drug
              discovery, materials development, and fine chemicals production.
              By coupling automation with rigorous data analysis, HTE makes
              experimental campaigns more systematic, reproducible, and
              predictive. As such, it is reshaping the way chemists design and
              optimize synthetic routes, bridging fundamental research and
              practical application on a scale that was previously unattainable.
